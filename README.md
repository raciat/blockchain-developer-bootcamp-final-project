# ðŸ’Ž Precious Stones Mint

Digital form of gemstones to store characteristics, track origin and history of ownership, and ensure legit source that is ethical.

## Problem

Currently, there is lack of transparency when it comes to precious stones. Origin is often unknown and there is no full history of ownership. Moreover, the characteristic of an asset could be stored so that once verified becomes its integral part, hence doesn't allow to tamper.

## Idea

The idea is to create decentralized market, where everyone can verify origin of gemstones and their characteristics.
Minting NFTs in the Ethereum using [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) would create different tokens per different products.
I would deploy a smart contract to mint NFTs specifically for diamonds which besides typical parameters would keep its clarity, cut, carat and color.

- Wholesale gemstone **manufacturers and suppliers** would be able to mint tokens for their products
- **Dealers** would be able to verify its origin and confirm characteristics
- **Clients** would be able to verify its origin, history and easily verify its characteristics if that was confirmed already
