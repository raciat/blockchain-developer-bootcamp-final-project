## Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Attacks

### Floating Pragma

[SWC-103](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103) *Floating Pragma* can be avoided by using specific version of compiler.
A common method is to use the `^` to indicate the lowest compiler version that a contract will work with, but this is dangerous.
To remediate, it is advised to lock the version of compiler to the one that was used for running test suites against the contract.
Therefore, both version of compiler in [Truffle configuration](./truffle-config.js#L100) and pragma in [PreciousStoneToken](./contracts/PreciousStoneToken.sol#L2) smart contract are set to version `0.8.2`.

### Authorization variable

[SWC-115](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-115) Using `tx.origin` variable for authorization could make a contract vulnerable if an authorized account calls into a malicious contract.
Therefore, `tx.origin` is not being used for authorization, `msg.sender` is being used instead.

### Function Default Visibility

[SWC-100](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-100) Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified are `public` by default.
To avoid this, all written functions have accessibility modifier specified, in this case to be: `public`, `internal` or `private`.
